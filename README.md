# Python-Challenge
Python hw


Here is the hw for the Python Challenge. This was a challenging one that I tried to get through the best I could. I found python very difficult and spent many many many many hours on this hw. The instructor said in class there are multiple ways to do pretty much everything so that definitely gives me some solice in my finished product.
